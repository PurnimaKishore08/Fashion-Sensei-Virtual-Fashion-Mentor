# Fashion Sensei
Fashion Sensei is an AI-powered virtual fashion mentor designed to provide personalized outfit recommendations based on individual style preferences and body measurements. Using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly K-means clustering and deep learning models like CNNs, the system analyzes user inputs—such as color, pattern, and clothing type preferences—to generate tailored fashion suggestions. A user-friendly interface collects these preferences and feeds them into the model, which is trained on diverse fashion datasets for both men's and women's clothing. The project achieves an accuracy of 82.5% in delivering relevant outfit suggestions, helping users confidently express their style while promoting inclusivity and sustainability in fashion. Fashion Sensei showcases the potential of combining AI with personal styling to revolutionize the online fashion experience.
